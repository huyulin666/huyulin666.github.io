						We know well enough that we are equipped with an innate drive for physical growth. That the human animal is geared to keep developing towards its outward mature form, adding muscle and bone and fatty tissue in a spontaneous process of development that begins in our earliest days in the boom and ends around our 16th year. What is less obvious is that we are marked by an equally innate equally powerful, although here lifelong drive towards emotional group. Without anything mystical being meant by this unless we are impeded by internal or external obstacles. We are set on an ineluctable path toward emotional development.
<br>我们很清楚，我们天生就有身体成长的动力。人类动物正朝着成熟的方向不断发展，我们增加肌肉、骨骼和脂肪组织，这一过程在最初几天蓬勃发展，在16岁左右结束。不太明显的是，我们与生俱来的同样强大的力量，我们一生都在向情感群体努力。没有任何神秘的意义，除非我们受到内部或外部障碍的阻碍。我们走上了一条不可避免的情感发展之路。
<br>
<br>An obvious conceptual difference between the 2 drives is that we can now easily enough what it means to be fully grown physically, but it's rather hard to pin down or equivalent in emotional maturity. Might look like we can hazard a 2-fold answer our emotional drive is made up of 2 strands. The first is a will towards ever greater and deeper connection. The second comprises a will towards ever greater and deeper self-expression to consider connection first. We are marked by an intense wish to move away from loneliness, shame and isolation and to find opportunities for understanding sincerity and community.
<br>这两种驱动力在概念上的一个明显区别是，我们可以很容易地理解身体完全发育意味着什么，但很难确定情感成熟度是否与之相当。也许我们可以猜测我们的情感驱动力是由两方面组成的答案。一方面是一种有更深联系。第二个是一个意志越来越强烈的自我表达。我们希望远离孤单、害羞和隔绝，并寻找机会去交流。
<br>
<br>To share with friends, lovers and new acquaintances and authentic picture of what it means to be us and at the same time to enter deeply into their feelings and experiences. What we call love is merely a subsection of the drive to connect which extends across a range of activities and types of relationship, stretching to encompass the body and our desire for physical intimacy.
<br>与朋友、恋人和新认识的人分享真实的照片以及那对我们意味着什么，同时深入了解他们的感受和经历。我们称之为爱的东西只是冲动的一部分，这种冲动跨越了一系列活动和关系，延伸到身体和我们对身体亲密的渴望。
<br>
<br>We can count ourselves, emotionally healthy in large measure, according to what degree of action. We have in our lives by the drive to self-expression. We mean the desire to fathom. Bring into focus and externalize our ideas and creative and intellectual capacities, a drive that manifests itself, particularly around our work and our aesthetic activities. We seek to gain an ever greater understanding of the contents of our minds, especially of our values are pleasures and our way of seeing the world and to be able to give these kind of expression that makes them public.
<br>很大程度上我们可以根据行动的程度来计算情绪是否健康。我们的生活中有自我表达的动力。指的是探索的欲望。关注并体现我们的想法、创造力和智力，这一驱动力在我们的工作和审美活动中表现得尤为明显。我们寻求对我们思想的内容，尤其是我们的价值观——快乐和我们看待世界的方式——有一个更深刻的理解，并能够表达出这种表达方式，使之公之于众。
<br>
<br>Comprehensible and beneficial to others. We will feel that we've had a rich life whenever we've been able to give a voice in shape to some of the many perceptions that caused through us and in some way, however, modestly left a fruitful imprint on the world. These 2 aspects of the dry for emotional growth help us to get a handle on some of our most acute moments of unhappiness. It's because of the primordial importance of the drive to connect but it hurts so much. When a friendship is broken off when an established relationship starts to black physical contact or when we can't find anyone. We see eye to eye with in a new city and it's because of how powerful the drive to self-expression is.
<br>易于理解并对他人有益。每当我们能够以某种形式表达通过我们产生的许多观念中的一些观念时，我们就会感到我们的生活丰富多彩。然而，在某种程度上，我们谦逊地在世界上留下了丰硕的印记。这两个方面的情感成长的干燥帮助我们得到了一些最严重的不快乐时刻的处理。这是因为动力连接的原始重要性，但它伤害太多了。当一段友谊破裂，当一段已建立的关系开始不正常的身体接触，或者当我们找不到任何人时。在一个新的城市里，我们的观点是一致的，这是因为自我表达的动力是多么强大。
<br>
<br>But we suffer so much when are studies failed to engage our minds? When a job ceases to reflect our interests or when on a Sunday evening we feel in a confused way that our talents are going to waste just. As the same drive can explain the intensity of the envy will feel when we hear of a friend's success in an area that we aspire to. Calling this aspect of human nature, a drive and equating it with that towards physical maturity emphasizes. It's essentially non negotiable nature and hence its power over us.
<br>但是，当学习不能吸引我们的注意力时，我们会遭受如此多的痛苦？当一份工作不再反映我们的兴趣时，或者在一个星期天晚上，我们感到困惑，我们的才能只会被浪费掉。正如同样的动力可以解释当我们听到朋友在我们渴望的领域取得成功时，嫉妒的强烈程度。将这一方面称为人类本性的驱动力，并将其与身体成熟的驱动力相提并论。它本质上是不可谈判的，因此它对我们的权力。
<br>
<br>Itis as misguided painful and nonsensical to try to stop someone growing emotionally as it is to bind their feet. The drive takes precedence over all manner of more convenient options. The longing for respectability money or stability. It won't leave us alone until it's been heard it might make us leave a marriage that would from many perspectives have been so much easier to remaining. Just throwing a job that was hugely convenient financially in order to take up another that more properly answers the call of our team selves.
<br>试图阻止一个人的情绪发展就像束缚他们的脚一样，是被误导的、痛苦的和荒谬的。驱动器优先于所有更方便的选项。对体面、金钱或稳定的渴望。它不会离开我们，直到有人听说它可能会让我们离开一段婚姻，从很多角度来看，这段婚姻更容易维持。只是丢掉一份经济上非常方便的工作，然后再去做另一份更符合我们团队要求的工作。
<br>
<br>If the drive to emotional growth continues to be unattended and perhaps even unknown to us. It can short circuit. Our whole lives in a bid to be heard fed up with waiting it may simply throw us into a paralyzing depression .Or lock us into a state of overwhelming anxiety by breaking us in these ways, the frustrated drive is trying to be interpreted and accommodated what it lacks in eloquence and focus. It makes up for in persistence and strength. A breakdown is a roundabout attempt to create opportunities for a breakthrough that is a new stage of emotional growth.
<br>如果情感成长的驱动力继续无人关注，甚至我们都不知道。它可能短路。我们的一生都在试图让别人听到我们对等待感到厌倦，这可能只会让我们陷入瘫痪的抑郁。或者通过这些方式打断我们，将我们锁定在一种压倒性的焦虑状态中，沮丧的驱动力试图被解释并适应它在雄辩和专注方面所缺乏的东西。它用毅力和力量来弥补。崩溃是一种迂回的尝试，旨在为突破创造机会，这是情感成长的新阶段
<br>
<br>By understanding more clearly how basic and important to drive to emotional growth can be. We may come to better recognize the symptoms of its frustrations and the logic of our longings and at points when we upset. The otherwise steady course of our lives in its name. We can be readier to explain to ourselves and those who care for us. What might be behind are puzzling behavior. We haven't forever lost our minds. We recognize the role of respectability and status. We would love to be less difficult and demanding it's just that. We have to honor another even more vital site to run nature. We are under an inner imperative to continue on our path towards emotional.
<br>通过更清楚地理解推动情感成长的基础和重要性。我们可能会更好地认识到它的挫折的症状和我们渴望的逻辑，以及在我们沮丧的时候。以它的名义，我们生活中其他方面稳定的过程。我们可以更容易地向自己和关心我们的人解释。背后可能是令人费解的行为。我们并没有永远失去理智。我们认识到尊重和地位的作用。我们希望变得不那么困难，要求也不那么苛刻。我们必须尊重另一个更重要的网站来运行自然。我们内心深处迫切需要继续我们的情感之路。
