Especially strong leadership.<br>领导力是我们现在经常听到的一个词。每次我们打开新闻,我们都会听说领导力是多么重要。特别是强有力的领导。<br><br>American presidents often talk about the importance of leadership. I suppose they’re right. It’s important that someone takes responsibility and shows leadership. <br>美国总统经常谈论领导力的重要性。我想他们是对的。重要的是要有人负起责任并表现出领导力。<br><br>With the right leaders, we can achieve success. But not every leader shows leadership. In many countries around the world, there are corrupt leaders. They do not have good leadership skills; they simply control people by fear. <br>有了正确的领导者，我们就能取得成功。但并非所有领导人都表现出领导力。世界上许多国家都有腐败的领导人。他们没有很好的领导能力；他们只是通过恐惧来控制人们。<br><br>Good leadership is being respected by everyone and getting the job done. It’s important to have good leadership in companies too, except many of the banks’ leaders have not shown such good leadership.<br>良好的领导能力是每个人都尊重并完成工作。在公司中拥有良好的领导能力也很重要，除非许多银行的领导没有表现出如此良好的领导能力。<br>

					<p id="p1"><b><br>I've been asked a lot since if there are any lessons I've learned about character and leadership. There are three lessons, I think that I have learned, that continue to instruct me to this day, that continue to guide me in both business and in life.<br>
						<br>很多人问我，在性格和领导力方面我有哪些经验教训。我觉得我有三个经验，它们一直在商界和生活中指引着我。
						<br><br>The first lesson is that values matter and character counts, and that no matter how much things change, fundamental values shouldn't. For those of you who are just starting out your career, you will find that in leadership-as perhaps in life-the most important decisions you make, and the toughest decisions you make are often the decisions you make alone.
						<br>第一个经验就是价值观很重要、性格很重要，不管发生什么变化，基本的价值观不能变。如果你才刚刚开始职业生涯，那么你将发现不管是在领导工作中还是在生活中，那些最重要的决定、最艰难的决定，往往是自己一个人做出的。
						<br><br>The second lesson I've learned about character and leadership is that leadership, just like success, is not a journey, it is a destination. It is perhaps a cliche to say that leadership is a journey not a destination but it is a cliche because it is true, leadership is journey. The only constant in any of our lives, whether you're running a company or running a family, or perhaps running a country is change.
						<br>第二个经验就是领导力和成功一样，它不是一个历程而是一个目的地。也许这句话说得太陈词滥调，但它是正确的。我们不管是办公司还是经营家庭或者是经营一个国家，都是不断变化的。
						<br><br>And the third lesson I've learned about leadership and success is that real power comes in the connections between all kinds of things, but most importantly real power comes from the connections between people. Power comes not from those who stand alone, but from those who can work best with others, and reach out to others to achieve a desired outcome. And finding those connections and recognizing those connections is part of what leadership is all about.
						<br>第三个经验是真正的力量来自于所有事物的联系，最重要的人与人之间的联系。力量不是来自于孤立的个人，而是来自能够同别人合作现理想结果的人。找到这些联系，认识这些联系，是领导力的真实体现。
						<br><br>As leaders, you can never forget that people want to do a good job. They want to be treated with consideration and respect. They want to feel a real sense of accomplishment in . their work, to have their ideas considered, and their achievements recognized. People want to feel like they're part of something larger than themselves---to be a party of the larger vision, direction, to be part of worthy goals.
						<br>作为领导者，你要知道员工们都想把工作做好，都想得到关心和尊重。他们希望在工作中获得成就感，希望自己的意见被采纳，成果被表彰。他们是希望处于一个更大的环境来支撑实现自己更大的目标。
