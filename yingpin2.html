						<section><b>Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist, although most people probably know him as the most intelligent person who ever lived.His name has become part of many languages when we want to say someone is a genius, as in the phrase, "She's a real Einstein".He must have been pretty brainy to discover the Theory of Relativity and the equation E=mc2.In 1999, 'Time' magazine named Einstein as the Person of the Century.No one could have guessed this would happen when he was at school.He was extremely interested in science but hated the system of learning by heart.He said it destroyed learning and creativity.He had already done many experiments, but failed the entrance exams to a technical college.He didn't let this setback stop him.When he was 16, he performed his famous experiment of imagining traveling alongside a beam of light.He eventually graduated from university, in 1900, with a degree in physics.Twelve years later he was a university professor and in 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for Physics.<br/></b>
